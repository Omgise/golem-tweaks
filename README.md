**Mr Crayfish** - 1.7.10 Forge Modding Tutorials on YouTube explained developer environments and basic mod structure.

**ganymedes0** - Code for ServerEventHandler.class in the Et Futurum mod helped to figure out how to replace vanilla golems with modded ones. This code was used under the Public Domain Licence.
Here is a list of changes to Forge's 1.7.10 MDK Gradle build script, to replace the official ForgeGradle 1.2 plugin with the fork. These changes are likely to work with most projects based on Forge's 1.7.10 MDK.

**thehippomaster21** - Code for healing Snow Golems from the Snowball projectile was sourced from MutantSnowGolem.class in the Mutant Creatures Mod on 22nd of November 2022 under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
